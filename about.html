		            <p>The world today is a global village and people are its citizens. As boundaries of location, people and time cease to exist, it is of utmost importance that we move with the 		times. At School, we have created a unique blend of world-class curricula, contemporary teaching methodologies, and equal focus on intellectual, physical and personality 		development, resulting future leaders who are ready to take on the world. Today, we stand as the force behind creating countless world-class doctors, engineers, IAS officers, 	      chartered accountants, and so much more.A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education, which is sometimes compulsory. In these systems, students progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught is commonly called a university college or university.</p>
